Experiment-2: Simple To-Do List SPA

Aim
----
To develop a basic To-Do List SPA using React.

Files
-----
- index.html — Single-file React app (CDN bundles + Babel) 
- styles.css — Styling for the app

Run
---
Open `index.html` in your browser. For the best experience (and to avoid any local file restrictions), serve the folder with a simple static server, for example:

Node (http-server):

```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server .
```

Then open http://localhost:8080 in the browser.

Notes
-----
- This implementation uses React and ReactDOM from a CDN and Babel for in-browser JSX compilation — intended for quick experimentation and learning.
- For production or larger work, scaffold a proper project (Vite / Create React App) and install React via npm.
